- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Java Script ðŸ’»**
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Laravel Framework**
- âš¡ Coding out of **love**, not just because of college assignments.
- âš¡ I used to be scared of coding â€” now I miss it when Iâ€™m not doing it.
- âš¡ A day without coding feels like something's missing... kinda like life without rice.
